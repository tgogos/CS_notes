# Are we really cloud-native?

> Kubernetes is the Greek god of spending money on cloud services

> There are people wearing this with pride; **there is no cloud, it's just somebody else's computer** at the other end of the Internet. This was **probably true, say, five or more years ago**. That was the state of cloud computing, it was just virtualization, but then taken elsewhere.

## move faster without breaking all the stuff
> In order to deal with this new world order that came upon us, with traditional business that needed to evolve and adopt faster, we needed ways to think about how we can move faster without breaking all the stuff that we have around. If you look at most enterprises, they are not like Silicon Valley unicorns which are only interested in doing new stuff, and more new stuff, and even newer stuff. They have their existing business to take into account. They have lots of stuff, which is already there, and which they need to take care of. You cannot just move fast without breaking stuff.
