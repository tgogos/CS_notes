# Are we really cloud-native?

> Kubernetes is the Greek god of spending money on cloud services

> There are people wearing this with pride; **there is no cloud, it's just somebody else's computer** at the other end of the Internet. This was **probably true, say, five or more years ago**. That was the state of cloud computing, it was just virtualization, but then taken elsewhere.

## move faster without breaking all the stuff
> In order to deal with this new world order that came upon us, with traditional business that needed to evolve and adopt faster, we needed ways to think about how we can move faster without breaking all the stuff that we have around. If you look at most enterprises, they are not like Silicon Valley unicorns which are only interested in doing new stuff, and more new stuff, and even newer stuff. They have their existing business to take into account. They have lots of stuff, which is already there, and which they need to take care of. You cannot just move fast without breaking stuff.


## cohesion over coupling
> You can ask, "Are you saying that microservices are a bad idea?" No that's not exactly what I'm trying to convey here, because to me, **microservices are like a modularity tool**. Modularity is always a good thing because it's breaking up bigger structures and smaller things so they are easily solvable. It's hiding the details of implementation, and then connecting stuff together, using some sort of contracts.

> This is the first thing that you'll learn when you start to do software design, cohesion, over coupling. There are a bunch of ways of introducing modularity. Some do it on the code level. If you have a large codebase, then you can start to introduce modularity on the language level. With things like a Java module system, or with OSGI, if you like, you can start to break up a bigger codebase into smaller modules, and then glue them together. When the pace of innovation or the pace of change goes up, you are more confident when you start modifying things over here, that things over there will not break down. Modularity is always a good tool. To me, **microservices is just another level of doing modularity**. If you break up the monolith, if you break up the large codebase into smaller parts, then you need to add that level to do modularity. Microservices to me, in essence, are a modularity tool.


## DevOps & Agile
Another huge problem area is DevOps. DevOps is not new, how can this be a problem area? The thing with DevOps is that there are parallels to draw between DevOps and agile. If you think back in time, when we started doing agile, the whole idea of Agile was really well-received. I think it didn't take us long to understand what it was about. It didn't take us long to understand what the benefits were, and then we started introducing it.

In order to reach a certain amount of maturity with things like agile adoption, it took us quite a few years. This is not because we were stupid as developers; this is because we have this heavy way thing dragging behind our feet, in which we had to transform the organization as well. Agile is only getting some maturity, as soon as you also have some buy-in from business. If you think, "Product owners, who needs them? We can ask the architects," that's probably very stupid thing to do, and that's what we learned over the years. DevOps is basically the same thing. It is not about learning a few new tools or mixing and matching, like some software engineers with some out-of-work DBAs, that's probably not the way to implement DevOps.

The problem with DevOps is dinosaurs - I'm not talking about the DBAs here, by the way - for sure it's called DINO and DINO is DevOps in name only. The thing with that is, dinosaurs are extinct. If you don't want your organization to go extinct, then you have to pay attention to how you implement DevOps.
