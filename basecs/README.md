## Whatâ€™s a Linked List, Anyway? [Part 1]

One characteristic of linked lists is that they are **linear data structures**, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. Linear structures, however, are the opposite of non-linear structures. In **non-linear data structures**, items don't have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure *non-sequentially*.
