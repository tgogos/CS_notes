## Worker Node Components: Container Runtime

To run and manage a container's lifecycle, we need a container runtime on the worker node. Some examples of container runtimes are: 

 - containerd
 - rkt
 - lxd

Sometimes, Docker is also referred to as a container runtime, but to be precise, **Docker is a platform which uses *containerd*** as a container runtime.
