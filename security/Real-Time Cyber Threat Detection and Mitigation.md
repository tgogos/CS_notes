## Security Through Obscurity

> So, in the cryptography community, security though obscurity means I'm going to make my cryptographic algorithm more secure by just not telling you what it is, and hoping that maybe you don't find out. Now, you can see how that's a terrible process, because in our world it seems like keeping secrets is almost impossible.
