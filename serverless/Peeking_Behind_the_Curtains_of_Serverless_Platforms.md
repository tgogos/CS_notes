# Peeking Behind the Curtains of Serverless Platforms

## Abstract

About this paper:

- largest measurement study to date,
- launching more than 50,000 function instances across these three services (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud
Functions),
- in order to characterize their architectures, performance, and resource management efficiency
- explain how the platforms isolate the functions of different accounts, using either virtual machines or containers, which has important security implications
- characterize performance in terms of scalability, coldstart latency, and resource efficiency,

Highlights:
 - AWS Lambda adopts a **bin-packing-like strategy** to maximize VM memory utilization,
 - **severe contention** between functions can arise in AWS and Azure,
 - Google had **bugs** that allow customers to use resources for free

## Introduction

 - Serverless computing (or function-as-a-service, FaaS) is an emerging application deployment architecture that completely **hides server management from tenants** (hence the name).
 - *Isolation*: A function usually executes in a **dedicated function instance (a container or other kind of sandbox)** with restricted resources such as CPU time and memory.
 - *Event-driven*: Unlike virtual machines (VMs) in more traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platforms, a function instance will be **launched only when the function is invoked** and is put to sleep immediately after handling a request.

Hiding resource management from tenants enables this programming model,...

**BUT:**

the resulting opacity hinders adoption for many potential users, who have expressed concerns about:
 - security in terms of the quality of isolation, DDoS resistance, and more...
 - the need to understand resource management to improve application performance
 - and the ability of platforms to deliver on performance

**Highlights of results:**

 - AWS Lambda achieved the **best scalability** and the **lowest coldstart latency** (the time to provision a new function instance), followed by GCF. But the **lack of performance isolation** in AWS between function instances from the same account caused up to a 19x decrease in I/O, networking, or coldstart performance.
 - Azure Functions used different types of VMs as hosts: 55% of the time a function instance runs on a VM with debased performance.
 - Azure had exploitable placement **vulnerabilities**: a tenant can arrange for function instances to run on the same VM as another tenantâ€™s, which is a stepping stone towards cross-function side-channel attacks.
 - An **accounting issue** in GCF enabled one to use a function instance to achieve the same computing resources as a small VM instance at almost no cost.
